# symptom_blaster
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created this script when I found out my parents owned the domain "symptoms.info"
<br>
# what does it do?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generates html files using combinations of adjectives/verbs that relate to illnesses<br>
# why?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was bored <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see what I could do with my coding talents <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this has potential to help people <br>
# how to use it:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. create a folder in working directory called htmls <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. go into terminal <br>
```
javac SymptomTags.java
java SymptomTags
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOOM! you should have like a million files in htmls! (not a million, this rhetorical device is called [hyperbole](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hyperbole))
